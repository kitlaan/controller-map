# Controller Map

A (hopefully) simple tool to create a (printable) controller binding map.

Features:

* xbox or playstation controller layouts (more TBD)
* WYSIWYG editor
* import via JSON
* share your custom maps via URL
* load predefined map from the repository

(Note: I only have a vague clue of ~~best~~ ~~good~~ okay practices for
modern web development, so if there's proper/better ways of doing things,
please submit PRs!)
